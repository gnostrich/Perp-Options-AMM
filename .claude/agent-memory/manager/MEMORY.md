# MEMORY — manager (cross-role rollup = state of the whole project)
_Last updated: 2026-06-08, bootstrap. This is the project's state-of-the-whole; git history is the
mechanical audit trail. Rewrite the changed bits at the end of every task._

## HEAD / verification
- **HEAD = `engine/builds/HEAD_temporal_mvp_v26a.html`, md5 `89ae89e9df229186b134ca6638726d0c`.**
  GH curve swap (v25) + v26a barrier-remnant fixes + slippage units fix.
- **Manager-verified at the Node level (2026-06-08, re-run on resume):** ran `engine/verify/run_all.sh`
  myself — 7 GH gates PASS (γ∈{1.5,2,3,4}), curveTrace 401/401 on the GH curve (worst slope err
  5.16e-12), marker on-curve (getMP_raw(eq)=136000.00), slippage splice-level PASS (0.99%/$3.46 →
  71.45%/$6240.94), loud-NaN guard OK. **UI owed to tester** — live browser run DISPATCHED (bg,
  agent a0b7eb8b). Lean = trusted-from-prover.
- **Branch:** working on `claude/pensive-sagan-WhNLb`. peaceful-volta-82pJP already merged to main
  (PR #1, HEAD e7c8ce9) — bootstrap scaffolding is on main.
- Blobs intact: webp `ab663f5c…` (line 74), svg `c505b08a…` (line 1060). File-safety hook live.

## Build lineage (engine/builds/BUILD_LINEAGE.md)
| file | md5 | what |
|---|---|---|
| temporal_mvp_v24_rebase_fixed_2 | 6f606f52 | clean barrier base (pre-GH) |
| temporal_mvp_v25_gh | 9910c699 | barrier→GH swap; 4 curve fns + calibration; 7 gates |
| temporal_mvp_v26a_fixes | 951d16eb | 3 barrier remnants fixed |
| temporal_mvp_v26a_2c0337e8_slipWIP | 2c0337e8 | slippage WIP — **known-broken (~97% flat)**, lineage only |
| **HEAD_temporal_mvp_v26a** | **89ae89e9** | slippage units fix (both paths → mpGeom) — **work from this** |

## Open threads (what | owner | status)
1. **Tester browser re-run on HEAD** | tester | **DONE 2026-06-08 (tester-confirmed, live Playwright
   Chromium, 0 console errors; build md5 unchanged 89ae89e9).** Verdicts: (1) Slippage display PASS
   (% primary, $ labelled reserve-USD). (2) Frame re-fit PASS — **keep current, do NOT apply the
   one-line revert** (freezing the frame clips the GH bend as it climbs out). (3) Curve geometry PASS
   — GH continuation, no barrier remnant. Evidence committed `evidence/v26a_pw/` (7db9b4d); harnesses
   `engine/verify/pw_v26a_visual.mjs` (PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/home/user/.cache/ms-playwright).
2. **Finding-2 — REFINED & re-surfaced to operator** | tester→manager→operator | Tester found v26a
   has **SPLIT behavior**, I verified the code localization myself: portfolio table (pfComponents,
   ray=K/oracle_now) + close engine (liveRay ~1976) are **dollar-anchored** ($84k/$68k HELD across
   rebase 80k→120k). But chart strike rays (`drawStrikeRay` ~3355, called 3389 with
   `thetaStarOf(b.sold.inner,b.sold.outer)` = stored ENTRY-θ) draw slope θ·oracle_now =
   K·oracle_now/oracle_entry ⇒ **rotate off the locked dollar strike on rebase**; same for chart $K
   lens (~3499) + drawStrikeMark (~3568). So engine ≈ already dollar-anchored (old "option B" largely
   done); residual defect is chart-display only. Operator call narrowed to: chart ray should track
   live dollar strike (align to table) vs intentionally show entry position. Awaiting operator.
   NOTE soft-flag: slippage scales hard with collar aggressiveness (0.2 BTC wide collar → 3463%,
   pool spot→~$0); display contract correct, magnitude input-driven — flagged for separate look.
3. **v26b — ITM/American build** | intern | **DISPATCHED → intern STOPPED-and-REPORTED pre-edit
   (correct discipline; no files touched, HEAD intact).** Three blockers surfaced; manager-verified:
   - **(a) `mark()` needs γ** — recoverable as `state.ghAh−1` (I verified exact for γ∈{1.5,2,3,4}).
     Requires extending `mark(wing,θ,sNorm)` → thread γ/state through ~8 call sites. **AUTHORIZED
     (manager):** signature change is part of the mark-rule task (file-safety "sigs unless that's
     the task" satisfied).
   - **(b) PUT-wing smooth-pasting boundary** — NEXT spec gives only the call wing; intern derived
     the put mirror & verified gate-clean. **I independently re-derived:** `sNorm*_put=θ·(γ/(γ+1))^γ`,
     `S*=K·(γ+1)/γ`, value-match exact, frac@bdry `1/(γ+1)`. Matches HISTORICAL spec
     `specs/historical/SPEC_itm_exercise_smooth_pasting.md`. **ESCALATED to operator** (CLAUDE §7:
     smooth-pasting boundary = settlement semantics). Rec: accept (forced mirror, historically
     specified, gate-clean).
   - **(c) funding consumes `mark()` (line 2138)** — rescaling mark would change funding's input;
     CLAUDE §4 LOCKS funding untouched/orthogonal. **RULING (manager, enforces the lock):** split —
     keep old saturating fraction as `markFrac(wing,θ,sNorm)` for funding (bit-identical), new
     continuation→intrinsic `mark` for value/portfolio/chart; remove `Math.min(1,…)` caps (lines
     ~3843-3845) on the UNBOUNDED option-leg only (§2: don't cap), bounded wing stays capped at 1.
     NOTE: §6 stop-condition (stage-2→3 dollar branch) was NOT tripped — intern confirmed
     `carvedNotional`/`entryPerpMark` unchanged-compatible.
   Bands render (§5) + seam-gate generalization (both wings) are ready & unambiguous. RE-DISPATCH
   intern with (a)+(c) authorized the moment operator ratifies (b). Build → NEW file
   `engine/builds/temporal_mvp_v26b_itm.html`; nothing becomes HEAD until I verify.
4. **Blob-ledger reconcile** | manager | **DONE & ratified (operator 2026-06-08): keep LINE layer
   `ab663f5c`/`c505b08a` canonical; decoded `8d2e1a84`/`1b320fc5` = documented secondary.** Wording
   fixed in CLAUDE.md §3, GOTCHAS §7, BUILD_LINEAGE, hook comments+error string, INTEGRITY (ratified
   note), agents/intern.md, docs/00_ORCHESTRATOR_START_HERE. Dated snapshots (STATE_snapshot_v26a,
   briefs/INTERN_SPLICE_NOTE, evidence/) left as historical. Intern to update its own MEMORY line.
   _History:_ **VERIFIED, awaiting operator ratification.**
   Decoded HEAD blobs at all 3 layers myself (2026-06-08): line-md5 `ab663f5c`/`c505b08a` (canonical,
   what the hook+run_all check) → DECODED-binary `8d2e1a84`/`1b320fc5`, b64-payload `d3ff8fc8`/`b6f0d67b`.
   273864 b64 × ¾ = 205398 exact; 5168 × ¾ ≈ 3875. ⇒ `8d2e1a84`/`1b320fc5` is **NOT a second/minified
   "broken cut"** — it's the *decode of the same canonical blob*. INTEGRITY.md was right; the "minified
   broken cut, never restore" narrative in CLAUDE.md/GOTCHAS/BUILD_LINEAGE/hook-comments is the actual
   error. Hook/harness key off the correct line layer ⇒ nothing operationally at risk. Reconcile =
   correct the narrative + ratify which layer is canonical (recommend keeping line layer = status quo).
   Held doc edits pending operator (touches shared-truth CLAUDE.md). Surfaced to operator 2026-06-08.
5. **Layer-2 honest-dollar slippage $** | manager/intern | DEFERRED, non-blocking. Route reserve-USD
   through the existing carved-perp settlement chain; reuse, don't improvise.
6. **Lean GH gate-discharge** | research-lead→Aristotle | OPEN. Instantiate GH, discharge 4 gate
   fields; watch `coercive = BddBelow` (bounded reserves).
7. **Ship-gate B1 — funding-coverage sweep** | manager/intern | OPEN. The one thing geometry can't
   close (κ is extrinsic). Necessary, not sufficient (B1/B3/B4 hypotheses).
8. **Publication** | paper | background. AfT 2026 (notif ~Jul 15), WINE 2026 (~Jul 2), FMBC 2027.

## Locked decisions (don't reopen unless the operator does)
- Curve-baked **GH only, γ>1, no barrier** (barrier exponent is outside the GH family; δ won't
  recover it). Carry **P = Ny/Nx** load-bearing; rebase recomputes P→P/r; anchor w=½, strike ray
  θ→θ/r on rebase; convexity knob γ∈(1,4).
- **Slippage** references `mpGeom = getMP_raw·e^(−ghMu)`; **% is basis-independent**; **$ = Layer-1
  reserve-USD** for now.
- **ITM → American smooth-pasting:** free boundary `sNorm* = θ·((γ+1)/γ)^γ`, price `S* = K·γ/(γ+1)`,
  `c = 1/((γ+1)·sNorm*)`. Funding = slope-deviation ratio vs the w=½ anchor at the strike ray —
  orthogonal to intrinsic, untouched by the ITM change.

## THE gotcha
`getMP_raw` is a **price coordinate**, not the slope: `|dy/dx| = getMP_raw·e^(−ghMu)` (11.7/44.5/749/13780
at γ=1.5/2/3/4). Gates are mostly **self-consistency**; the one accuracy gate is G4 (value∝S^(−γ));
ITM adds a seam gate. A price/slope conflation passes every self-consistency gate. Re-derive against
geometry; comments lie.

## Escalation (Gate 2)
Autonomous = how-to-execute (dispatch spec'd work, harnesses, re-derive, audit proofs, git, blob-safe
passes behind the hook). Escalate to operator = what-we're-building (curve/invariant, settlement
semantics, reopen a locked decision/ship-gate, product calls Finding-2 / |Γ|>1 / Fork A-vs-B,
calibration tier, paper claims). Irreversible/high-blast-radius escalates regardless.

## Waiting on operator (bootstrap)
- `GH_TOKEN` (PAT, full repo control) + `gh` install → then I **merge the scaffolding branch to main**.
- Playwright network grant + browser install → tester's live v26a run.
- Operator reply **"go"** = checklist done.
