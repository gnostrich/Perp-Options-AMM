# MEMORY — tester
_Last updated: 2026-06-08, after live v26c_full2 uniform-strike-registration browser confirmation._

## DONE — live v26c_full2 browser confirmation (build 6cc73563…)
Ran **live Playwright Chromium** against `builds/temporal_mvp_v26c_full2.html`. Build md5
`6cc73563779a3e030774b7597d0ae187` unchanged (no engine edit); blobs `ab663f5c…`/`c505b08a…`
intact; 3 scripts parse. Oracle `run_all.sh builds/temporal_mvp_v26c_full2.html` GREEN incl. SEAM
GATE + **DIR GATE PASS** (γ∈{1.5,2,3,4}, mutation-detected). Note: run_all.sh COPIES the passed
build into a scratch file literally named `temporal_mvp_v26b_itm.html` (line 16) and the seam/dir
gates read that scratch copy — so the "v26b_itm" filename in gate headers is the scratch name, the
CONTENT is v26c_full2. Harness: `engine/verify/pw_v26c_visual.mjs`. Reproduced clean across 2 runs
(chart-vs-table diff identical to the bit; not flaky).

### KEY ENABLER (new): `Engine` AND `Store` ARE reachable inside `page.evaluate`
Classic-script top-level `const`s (Engine line 1590, Store line 2255) live in the page global and
ARE visible to `page.evaluate` (unlike Node import, which can't see them). So the live oracle of
record here is the page's OWN engine called against the live `Store.state.pool` + the rendered DOM
mark cells — strongest possible evidence. (Prior v26b memory said "NOT on window"; that's true for
`window.Engine`, but `typeof Engine !== 'undefined'` inside evaluate is TRUE. Probe-confirmed.)

### Verdicts (FLAG per item)
1. **Bands table crossover at K — PASS (tester-confirmed, live engine + rendered DOM).** The
   OTM→ITM **regime** crossover (`legIsITM`) requires a pool-SPOT move, not a rebase: set oracle then
   click **#btn-arb (Run Arbitrage to Oracle)** to push poolMark to the oracle. Then `soldITM` flips
   **false→true EXACTLY at oracle=poolMark=120000=K** (119900 OTM, 120000 ITM) for the SOLD call
   K=$120k, γ=2 build. `legIsITM` uses price-measure `sNorm0=poolMark/oNow` vs live ray `K/oNow` ⟺
   poolMark≥K. All-γ crossover-at-K is the Node DIR_GATE's job (PASS, manager-verified); browser
   confirms γ=2 live. Registration identity verified: `getMP_raw(arbitrageToOracle(pool,K))=K`
   exactly (120000.0000000003), `getSNorm(that)=thetaReg`. `11_bands_table_crop.png` (ITM, oracle
   $130k, SOLD mark 0.3333) + `12_bands_table_OTM_crop.png` (OTM, oracle $100k).
   - GOTCHA: a pure oracle REBASE (kpi-oracle alone, no arb) does NOT cross the strike — it carries
     the position with the frame (poolMark stays fixed, soldITM never flips). That's correct
     (absorbed Finding-2). Must arb to move spot through K.
2. **Chart strike-ray live on the position — PASS (tester-confirmed, rendered).** Curve view: white
   eq-marker on the GH curve; green (put) / red (call) strike rays from origin with trade-dots ON
   them. Rebasing oracle 80k→160k (`08b`→`08c`) **rescales the frame and repositions the rays**
   (live K/oracle), marker stays on curve — no stale entry-θ drift (the absorbed Finding-2). Curve
   is GH continuation, not Balancer weight-form. Drift table (item2_drift in trace): leg.inner
   (entry-frozen θ, sold 1.5 const) vs sNormStrike(pool,K) (live, sold 0.4446→0.0494 across sweep) —
   they diverge post-rebase, confirming the live path is used, not the stale entry value.
3. **Re-based payoff matches the table — PASS (tester-confirmed, exact numeric).** At the live spot
   (r=0) the chart's legFraction == bands-table markEff == rendered DOM mark cell, **|diff|=0.0
   exactly** both legs: SOLD 0.24169229297386294 (DOM 0.2417), BOUGHT 0.2826730030550262 (DOM
   0.2827). Same registered carry basis. Payoff frame is **−90%..+200%** asymmetric (`09_payoff`),
   renders cleanly across the full range, downside floors at $0, free-boundary kink visible at left,
   no NaN/blank/clip. Rebased-160k (`09b`) rescales Y-axis to $375k, still clean. (Payoff chart is
   canvas-only — no DOM data table — so the numeric compare is the page's own legFraction closed
   form vs the rendered table cell; both evaluated live against Store.state.pool.)
4. **No v26b regression — PASS (tester-confirmed, rendered).** Polar mark "Mark Across Strikes"
   (`canvas-pricing`, `07_polar_mark_pricing.png`): green dot (~$80k) and red dot (sold call ~$138k)
   both sit exactly ON their ψ-curves (pink put-wing / teal call-wing), peak 1.0 at the mode —
   continuity through strike, no drift. Bands §5 columns all present & correctly labelled (9 cells/
   comp row, OPEN/CLOSE, headers verbatim in trace.item1_headers). Matches v26b.

### Provenance summary
- tester-confirmed (rendered pixels): items 1 (table crops), 2 (curve rays), 3 (payoff frame), 4
  (polar mark). Numeric cross-checks: page's OWN Engine/Store live (NOT a Node re-derivation).
- Node oracle incl. seam + dir gate: PASS against v26c_full2 (scratch-named v26b_itm).
- VERDICT: all 4 PASS, clean ×2, no regression. Recommend HEAD promotion clear from the visual layer.

### Repro
`cd engine; PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers node verify/pw_v26c_visual.mjs`
Crossover-at-K (arb-driven): set #kpi-oracle then click #btn-arb, read Engine.legIsITM live.
Oracle gate: `cd engine; sh verify/run_all.sh builds/temporal_mvp_v26c_full2.html` (seam+dir PASS).
Chromium binary at BOTH `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194` and `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1194`;
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers` is the one that resolved here. tmp harnesses must live
under `engine/` so `import 'playwright'` resolves `engine/node_modules/`.

### Gotchas learned (v26c)
- chart-select option values: `curve` (canvas-curve, GH pool curve + strike rays), `pricing`
  (canvas-pricing, polar Mark-Across-Strikes — item-4), `trajectory` (canvas-ratio), `payoff`
  (canvas-payoff, the −90%..+200% sim).
- Band validation (#btn-execute disabled): bought PUT K must be < oracle (OTM put); sold CALL K >
  oracle (OTM call). With oracle=$80k: sold 120000 / bought 68000 works; bought 90000 fails
  ("not OTM on put wing"). Needs a perp added first (club.totalNotional>0).
- carry sNorm is INVERSE to price (sNorm ∝ S^−γ): higher K → lower thetaReg. `isOTM`/`wingMember`
  use the PRICE-RATIO leg.inner (K/oracle, ∝S^+1), NOT the carry theta — feeding carry theta to
  isOTM gives wrong answers. The v26c design deliberately keeps entry-checks on price-ratio,
  value/mark on carry (sNorm(K)). Don't conflate.

## Prior runs (still-valid context)
- v26b (8df9f8a3…): items 1/2/4 tester-confirmed, item-3 uncapped-vs-capped logic-only (chart window
  too narrow then; v26c's −90..+200 frame now clears the free boundary so legs render past it).
  Seam gate PASS. `evidence/v26b_pw/`.
- v26a: Finding-2 was open (curve/ratio chart ratio-pegged, table dollar-anchored) — **now ABSORBED
  in v26c**: chart rays are live K/oracle, table+chart+settlement all carry-registered at sNorm(K).
  Slippage display PASS, frame re-fit PASS (don't revert), curve = GH continuation.
