# MEMORY — skeptic
_Updated 2026-06-10 after first charter pass (run as "skeptic-charter run via general-purpose
runner" — agent type registers next session)._

## The motive (your lens — operator's words, 2026-06-10, verbatim)
> "the skeptic has to have a very concise crisp understanding of the project motive (curve warp
> amm from balancer, need kurtosis knob, everything else remains same sort of thing)"
Expanded form lives in CLAUDE.md §0 and your charter. Checklist: `docs/feature_inventory.md`.
⚠ CAVEAT (my own finding): CLAUDE.md §0 and inventory item 2 currently CARRY two claims I broke
(see below) — until the manager corrects them, do not treat those two sentences as settled truth.

## Why you exist (operator's words, 2026-06-10, verbatim)
> "lack of an adversarial sort of devils advocate agent to check gaslighting by the manager and
> research guy agents for example excluding core features like the curve warp thing when we're
> brainstorming a curve / invariant change to get a kurtosis knob (vs the balancer v24
> implementation)"

## Verdicts issued
1. **2026-06-10 — KURTOSIS_KNOB note (retroactive, PR #18/#20)** →
   `notes/skeptic/VERDICT_KURTOSIS_KNOB_2026-06-10.md`. Verdicts: 2× FLAG-WRONG (§0 "no clean
   algebraic invariant exists" — refuted by explicit closed form
   `x^{w_mid}y^{1−w_mid}·exp(−(Δw/2)√(τ²+ln²(y/x)))=k`, constant to 5.6e-16, correct slope law;
   and "τ:=δ EXACTLY / engine = the single setting τ=0.08" — τ_implied runs 0.012→2.41 at β=1,
   0.05→2.40 at β=0; GH wing weights degenerate (1,0); kernel sits in the SCORE for GH, in the
   WEIGHT for (W) — different curves), 1× FLAG-OVERSELL (Object-L "(= engine)" + "[0,3]" computed
   at β=0; engine β=1 gives skew +0.92, excess kurt 3.285 ∉[0,3]; direction survives),
   1× FLAG-OMISSION (#8 strike reg, #9 funding, #13 solvency absent; #4 carry coordinate
   mis-stated; §5 survival claims asserted-by-carry from REPARAM, not shown, and don't transfer
   to (W)), 1× FLAG-PROCESS (manager re-derived only F2, narrated the broken headliners into
   shared truth same day). Both broken claims live in CLAUDE.md §0 + inventory item 2 → handed
   to manager for correction (I don't edit those).

## Claims that survived attack (settled — don't re-attack without new evidence)
- **Asymptote preservation (KURTOSIS F2):** γ_loc(±100τ) τ-independent, errs 3.12e-5/1.25e-4
  reproduced byte-identical; analytic via the closed-form invariant (wings = exact CD monomials).
- **Kurtosis sign-split (F6):** pushforward platykurtic −1.1163 @ τ=0.3 (note: −1.116) vs latent
  leptokurtic; label warning "fatness dial = 1/τ, never ship τ-up=fatter" is CORRECT (holds at
  β=1 too, direction-wise: 3.285→2.153 for τ 0.08→0.3).
- **β=0 Object-L table values** (2.6530/1.6885) — correct as symmetric-slice facts.
- **(W) endpoints:** τ→∞ = constant-w CD, τ→0 = Laplace step — exact in the closed form.
- **REPARAM v2's core** (CD = δ→∞; Esscher slope law δ/β-free; δ = ATM-elbow knob) — leaned on
  it, consistent with everything I computed; not independently attacked end-to-end.

## Team blind-spot patterns observed
1. **Confidence markers anti-correlate with verification.** "EXACTLY / confident / structural"
  flagged the two claims that broke; every claim with attached digits (F1–F7) reproduced.
  (Now 3 data points: CURVE_SWAP δ-direction, RUN-3 rfl-tautology, KURTOSIS §0+τ:=δ.)
2. **Manager verifies the cheapest load-bearing item, narrates the rest** — and narrated claims
  reach CLAUDE.md/shared truth within a day of merge. Audit reports: always ask "which SPECIFIC
  number did the manager recompute?"
3. **Symmetric-slice numerics sold at the asymmetric engine pin (β=1).** Recurring: REPARAM/HET/
  KURTOSIS all compute at β=0; engine is β=1 (skew +0.92, kurt >3, put-only, degenerate weight
  endpoints). ALWAYS re-check any "= engine" label at β=1.
4. **Construction-slot conflation:** kernel-in-the-SCORE (GH) vs kernel-in-the-WEIGHT ((W)) —
  same kernel, different curve. Watch for "same formula ⇒ same object" leaps (sibling of THE
  price-vs-slope gotcha).
5. **Impossibility claims argued from one failed candidate** ("the CD monomial isn't constant ⇒
  no invariant exists"). Steelman by actually integrating/constructing before accepting any
  "no X exists" flag — the √-kernel was elementary-integrable all along.

## Method notes (env)
- No mpmath/numpy here. Pure python3 float64 + dense Simpson/trapezoid reproduces the team's
  mpmath digits to ~1e-3 or better; calibrate against a known note value first.
- (W)-membership test for any curve: w_eff = ℓY/(ℓY+ℓX) vs ũ=ln(Y/X); τ_implied =
  (ũ−c)√(1−r²)/r must be constant. Reusable.
