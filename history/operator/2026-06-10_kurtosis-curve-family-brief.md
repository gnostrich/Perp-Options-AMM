_Context: curve-family brief for the kurtosis knob; closing paragraph is phrased in the skeptic's voice (a relay of the skeptic's offer to persist the brief), put to the manager to decide. Transcribed verbatim as received on the operator channel._

> TARGET: a closed-form one-parameter curve family that replaces plain Balancer, where the parameter is a kurtosis knob.
>
> Geometry (the spec): in log-coordinates the curve is a straight line (= Balancer). The knob bows the middle (rounds the ATM elbow). The two ends keep their straight slope no matter the knob (wings = exact power-laws, knob-independent). One number, static, set once for vol.
>
> Acceptance (your signed test, orthogonality relaxed): one number → turn it → elbow visibly rounds → wings don't move → static → options read off as perpetual-American → trades warp the curve, not a dot sliding.
>
> Yardstick (existence, not mandate): a closed form satisfying "bow the middle + freeze the wings" demonstrably exists — so reject any "can't be done" and any wing-bender. They're free to find a cleaner or non-trig one.
>
> Constraints: "everything else stays the same" — carry, value∝S^(−γ), smooth-pasting, funding, the dollar pipe are contracts the new curve must still satisfy (re-derive, don't assume). Plug into the research scaffold + paper + v24 HTML, replacing plain Balancer. Prove closed-form settlement survives on the new curve before committing the rebuild.
>
> Standing flags: trig (Gudermannian/tanh/cosh) is team-introduced encoding — it must earn its place by hitting the geometry above, not get adopted because it's elegant.
> Want me to persist that brief as a skeptic verdict file so it's durable in the repo? I can write it (my space, my right) — but committing/pushing it is a manager step, and I won't leave untracked churn again without you saying so. Tell me (a) or (b), and whether to write the file.
